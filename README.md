# Rhythm-game

This Unity project was made because I was interested in learning how to program a rhythm game.
I made a whole system that would allow me to use the unity timelines to make a beatmap so all the systems to program a ryhtm game are in place.

I stopped working on this project because I was missing the necessary art (more specifically enemy sprites) to keep working on it and making them was taking a really long time which I don't have because of uni.
